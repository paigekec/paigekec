Hi, I’m @paigekec!
<!--- - 👀 I’m interested in ... --->

part coder, part automation wizard

I build things that make work way easier:
🧠 machine learning models,
🤖 RPA bots,
⚙️ workflow automations,
and the occasional “I saved us 20 hours a week with one script” moment.

I’ve spent the past few years turning messy processes into clean, scalable systems and helping teams use AI without the stress. If it involves Python, SQL, Power Platform, or integrating five tools that shouldn’t play nicely together… I’m in.

Current interests:
✨ AI that actually solves problems
✨ Automating anything that moves
✨ Dashboards that don’t make your eyes hurt
✨ Teaching computers to do the boring stuff so humans don’t have to

When I’m not coding, you can find me plotting my next automation, predicting something with a random forest, or explaining to someone why “just use a spreadsheet” is not a long-term solution.

Let’s build cool stuff. 🚀
